\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}\index{Motivation}


Sometimes we get lost on the true origin of Engineering.
Which is the practical implementation of mathematics.  Since my entrance course to Engineering as undergraduate students, I started to gather mathematical notes.  This motivation came as a suggestion from Professor .
The number 3 sheets are very old by now, and they are really rotting, but I found that those notes are a one-to-one mapping of the structure in my brain where I think I understand those concepts.  If you are here to get a deep understanding of many concepts, this is not the place.  I happen to be a very good generalist, and I try to tackle broadly as general as I can, and I only deep digger in few areas.  I tried always to catch the underlying idea, the key concept.  Well, I failed.  In general, I couldn't do this.  Anyway, these notes helped me a lot, and I found that it also helped others, particularly my students and colleagues.

Additionally, if I manage to write everything, I can add references of papers and book, everything in one place, which will be very handy for me.

I abuse the word Engineering too much.  It is so vast, so big, so complex at the same time that there are huge areas that I am missing in this book.  This notes inevitably have my own approach to this area.  Like a hiker going up to the mountain, they only see their own side.   However there is something that I would like to point out.  And that is the spirit of engineering, their soul:  get the foundations, understand the problem, find a match in the foundations, get data, get more date, try to get a ground on what do you think, tinckle something, hack it, try to fix it. If nothing works use WD40 and duct tape.

Engineering is grounded in science, but I think it understands more humbly how the world operates, and the futility, in some way, of our actions.  That is way, it has a certain pragmatism, at the end, that is much more closer to nature than science itself.  Science is sometimes more pedantic, believing it can understand Nature, but you know of course, that Nature cannot be fooled. QUOTE !


\section{Objective}\index{Objective}

The purpose of this work is to establish in a step by step and constructive fashion a set of mathematical concepts from a pragmatic point of view, of mathematical ideas that are useful to engineering.

Everything that is written here is exactly what I understand. If anything is besides this notes, I just put it in the category of "Not-understanding".  

What I found is that I came to this notes, many times, adding more information and connections to other things, and I will always understand the same things from a different and completely new perspective.

After a while I found that I will be very disappointing of loosing those notes so I decided to write them down digitally. And have a backup with that.

How can you translate something that you created with your own pen ?  from your own handwriting ?  into something digital that is feel so cold to the naked eye.

Someone may found these notes useful.  I believe that will be for two reasons:  I wanted to create them in a constructive way: if I cannot find some rule to justify what I am doing then I am not doing anything, it doesn't exist.  The second reason is that I always found mathematics to be hard.  I love to understand it but it takes time to do it, to sit down.  At the same time, "undestanding" is not binary.  The best analogy I found is like a complex and evolutive graph or a tree-like structure, with many branches.  Let's say you understand something.  Then you have only "one path" to go from point A to point B of the concept.   But you can only walk across that path, and you, somehow, can follow the train of thinking from one place to the other.  However you cannot connect it to other things.  When you teach, somebody may point out the existence of point C closer to both.  But you were completely unaware of it until some student ask you something about it.  Then you discover that connection (and manage to give a response to the poor student, which it will be satisfactory or just mumble jamble).  Then you start to discover many more ramificiations and your level of understanding increases.  So understanding, is the level of ramification that you know of something, how much can you connect the concept to others.   

for Control engineerings for instance, everything can be a control problem.  The same can be applied to the "Rule of 3" or proportions or fractions.  Or algebra.  These very important tools allows you to tackle problems that is the reason they are so ubiquous.  In such way the Consciousness theory share some intuition with these concepts, measuring the level of integration and connectivity (Rhythms of the brain).

Since I found so much good information about pretty much everything I wanted to know about, I will just create a remark and let you know where you can find more specific information about, just like below.

\begin{remark}

\chapter{Precalculus}

The best book of Precalculus is Zill \cite{ZillBook}.  I will recommend this book to anyone to have a grasp on the mathematics that is in general required to enter Universities.

Zill has another book on complex analysis which is also great.  You will have to wait for complex numbers until we get signal processing, because I believe is their real place in Engineering.

\section{Qualitative Analysis}

\section{Complex Numbers}

\begin{equation}
z = (x, y)
\label{eq:c1}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
Re \; z = x
\label{eq:c1}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
Im \; z = y
\label{eq:c1}
\end{equation}

\section{Further work}
Well, finally we reached the point where I my time in Canada finished and I this research is still on its first stages. I have so many ideas of how to explore the clustering techniques in the DAME platform, MatLab, Python and everything else that can be tested \cite{Linde2012}

\chapter{Number Theory}

By far, the most interesting part of Number Theory is Hardy's quote:

This branch of mathematics will never be touch by the mundane pragmatism.

Or something like that.  Well, dear Hardy, you were right but you are now wrong.  This branch of mathematics has found in Cryptography one enormous directo applicaton of mathematics.  Such is this case, that if one very fundamental problem of mathematics like finding quickly and efficiently the primes factors of a really big number is theoretically tackled, it will immediate bring down half of ecomerce operations worldwide, will destroy companies, and will cost huge amount of money.  Anyway, this will never happen. 

\chapter{Pragmatic Control Theory}

That thing you are doing is called proportional control. \cite{book_key}.
